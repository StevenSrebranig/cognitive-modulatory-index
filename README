# Cognitive-Modulatory Index (CMI)

This repository supports future **empirical validation, replication studies, and sensitivity analysis**
for the **Cognitive-Modulatory Index (CMI)**.

CMI is a theory-driven framework for evaluating how symbolic texts behave under controlled
modulation (Lucid/Dream cycles). It is presented as a **falsifiable research hypothesis**, not
a validated measurement instrument or software tool.

## 📄 Primary Reference

The theoretical framework is published at Zenodo:

**Srebranig, Steven F.**  
*The Cognitive-Modulatory Index (CMI): A HuSCoT Module for Quantifying Mindprint Maturity in Symbolic and Cognitive Systems*  
Zenodo. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17924893

Please cite the Zenodo paper when referencing CMI.

## 🚧 Current Status

- No reference implementation is provided at this time
- Numerical examples in the paper are illustrative placeholders
- Validation studies described in Section 9.6 of the paper are forthcoming
- This repository currently contains documentation only

## 🔬 Planned Contents (Non-Binding)

Future additions may include:
- draft-vs-final corpora used in validation studies
- replication notebooks
- sensitivity analyses for component weights
- null and adversarial control experiments

Any implementation details will remain explicitly non-normative unless stated otherwise.

## ⚠️ Scope Limitations

CMI:
- is **not** an authorship detector
- does **not** rank aesthetic quality
- does **not** replace human editorial judgment
- should not be used in high-stakes evaluative contexts
